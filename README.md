### Hey-Day History

During World War II, Auburn University’s student body and members of the Student Government Association pushed for a day that would unite the Auburn Family and promote a friendly atmosphere known as HEY DAY.

Each year, the university carries on this tradition of handing out name tags and encouraging students, faculty, and the rest of the Auburn Family to greet one another with the Auburn Spirit in an effort to bring all these parts of Auburn closer together. HEY DAY has become one of Auburn University’s longest and most cherished traditions and is a day the student body has grown to love and look forward to each year.
